    <h3 style="color:green">An Enemy of the People <i>- Henrik Ibsen</i> </h3>

    <h4 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann. </h4>
    <p class="Speech"> Won't you go in and have something, Mr. Hovstad? My
        husband is sure to be back directly.</p>

    <h4 class="Hovstad"> Hovstad. </h4>
    <p class="Speech">Thank you, perhaps just a morsel.</p>
    <p class="Directions" >[Goes into the dining-room.]</p>

    <h4 class="Peter Stockmann"> Peter Stockmann </h4>
    <p class="Directions" >[lowering his voice a little]. </p>
    <p class="Speech">It is a curious thing
        that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.</p>

    <h4 class="MrsStockmann"> Mrs. Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class="Speech">Surely it is not worth bothering about! Cannot you and
        Thomas share the credit as brothers?</p>

    <h4 class="PeterStockmann">Peter Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class="Speech">I should have thought so; but apparently some people
        are not satisfied with a share.</p>

    <h4 class="MrsStockmann"> Mrs. Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class="Speech"> What nonsense! You and Thomas get on so capitally
        together.
    <p class="Directions" >[Listens.]</p>There he is at last, I think. <p class="Directions" >[Goes out and opens
        the door leading to the hall.]</p>
    </p>

    <h4 class="DrStockmann"> Dr. Stockmann.</h4>
    <p class="Directions" >[laughing and talking outside].</p>
    <p class="Speech"> Look hereâ€”here is
        another guest for you, Katherine. Isn't that jolly! Come in, Captain
        Horster; hang your coat up on this peg. Ah, you don't wear an overcoat.
        Just think, Katherine; I met him in the street and could hardly
        persuade him to come up!
    <p class="Directions" >[CAPTAIN HORSTER comes into the room and
        greets MRS. STOCKMANN. He is followed by DR. STOCKMANN.]</p> Come along in,
    boys. They are ravenously hungry again, you know. Come along, Captain
    Horster; you must have a slice of beef. <p class="Directions" >[Pushes HORSTER into the
        dining-room. EJLIF and MORTEN go in after them.]</p>
